# Algorithms and Data Structures Javascript

## What is in this repository?

As the name implies this will be a repo for me to play around with Algorithms and Data Structured in javascript as I go through Cracking the Coding Interview and other sources. I would revive the other algorithms repo, however, that one is primarily in Java.

## Tests

To run the tests, type 'npm run test'. If you want to run an individual test you can add '.only' to either after the describe or it block like 'describe.only'. Another way is to type 'mocha' + the path and file name of the test you want to run.

# Algorithms and Data Structures Javascript

## What is in this repository?

As the name implies this will be a repo for me to play around with Algorithms and Data Structured in javascript as I go through Cracking the Coding Interview and other sources. I would revive the other algorithms repo, however, that one is primarily in Java.
